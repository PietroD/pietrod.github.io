I am a PhD candidate in Biotechnology at the University of Verona. Officially. But I prefer to consider myself as a newbie in everything. This means that I am very curious and I love to learn and discover new things.

Apart from the romanticisms, I like life sciences and as a PhD candidate in Biotechnology (plant genetics) my project aims at [**the identification of the genes involved in the regulation of flowering and veraison in grapevine**](docs/Delfino_Poster_SIGA_2017.pdf). Veraison is that stage of berry development where the berries start to become soft and change color (from green to white/red).

The approaches I am following are mainly *in silico*; that means that I work most of the time at my laptop with genomic sequences, genetic polymorphisms and phenotypic data. For the specialists, this is a genetic association study (i.e. Genome-Wide Association Study [**GWAS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study), or Candidate-Gene Association Study). Some they consider me *Bioinformatician*, I prefer the term *Computational biologist*, since I trained as a biotechnologist and I had not informatic competences more or less two years before now.

Recently I fall in love with [**data**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) and ways to manipulate them. Since then I became interested in that wonderful world related to [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/), which is my daily working "language".
